# MAMMAL
MAMMAL is a 12-DoF quadruped capable of executing multiple GAIT's and can traverse all terrain situations 

Mammal robot is 12-DOF quadruped (4 Legged Robots)  designed for autonomous operation in difficult terrains. 
The goal is to build unmanned legged vehicles with rough-terrain mobility superior to existing wheeled and tracked vehicles. 
Legged locomotion vehicles present superior mobility in natural terrains, since these vehicles may use discrete footholds for 
each foot, in opposition to wheeled vehicles, that need a continuous support surface. The feet may establish contact with the ground 
in selected points in accordance with the terrain conditions. It is capable of extracting data regarding the terrain profile and also 
performing surveillance and localization/SLAM using its vision capabilities. It has the capability to integrate sophisticated sensor 
technologies in order to perform the variety of functionalities that are expected of it in the line of defense. To facilitate navigation, 
the robots take feedback from inertial, vision, and force sensors. The compact and lightweight structure makes it highly portable, and 
its modular design allows for greater scalability and scope for added capabilities, eg. carry and deliver payloads. The ideal system
would travel anywhere a person or animal could go using their legs, run for many minutes at a time, and carry its own fuel and payload. 
It would be smart enough to negotiate terrain with a minimum of human guidance and intervention.
